# Pizza-Prototype

## Project Description

 Our project represents a Pizza website. We have a Login option, used to save the orders in our database. We also have a MENU button which shows every pizza that we have on the menu, a CONTACT button, which provides us with a form to complete, to help users file their complains to us. Moreover, we have the posibility to filter the pizzas on the menu by certain allergens. When the user selects all the pizzas he wants to buy, he can add them to the cart and then place an order.
